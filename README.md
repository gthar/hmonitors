# hmonitors

This is a collection of monitors the I use as widgets in xmobar.
Currently implemented:

* battery (through acpi)
* volume (through alsa)
* network (through network-manager)

They are all one-shot scripts, intended for xmobar to run periodically.
They are very ad-hoc to my use case. Even the icons (using NerdFonts) and
colors (I use the gruvbox color scheme) are hard-coded.
